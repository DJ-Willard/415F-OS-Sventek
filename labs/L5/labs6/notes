threads are a register space.
it has its own stack memery 
runing in a process
fork makes process


the thread puts the register, pc, and stack

kernal is the data used by fucntions in the kernal 
it is a set of functions that drive devices and handle device interruts
set of functions that manage the scarce resources of the computer
The kernal is Data in memory with veribale data

Thread invokes a system call 
thread invokes the TRAPinstuctions
the trap instruction sets the execution mode for your thread to kernal mode
your thread executes the kernal function for the system call

finally, your thread executes a RTF(return for trap)
instrctution that causes the thread mode 

interupt saves restiters and pc on the stack
your thread is execting the interrupt


project 2 you have 5 public functions to call

b/u write  b/u read and voucher

inzitialaztion 

may need to make threads to create concerency and then must unite witht he programm.

data structre may be needed.

50 linies of code is what you need 

pthread laibary (mutex crictial region)

assume single processor everything is serial 

Need to know how to write code with no understaning what people are doing above you and below you.


you work in a team  with poeple above and below.

Take 432, 431 concurrent progaming. 433, cyber securtity.
