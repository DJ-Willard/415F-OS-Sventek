The following calls to DIAGNOSTICS() occur in the disk device module for
Project 2.  If you see these in the output from your solution to the
project, you are doing something wrong, and need to fix it.


1. DIAGNOSTICS("BUG: Two or more parallel calls to write a sector\n");
If you see this diagnostic, your code has called the device to write a sector
while it is still processing the previous write.  The write side of the
device can only handle one sector at a time.

2. DIAGNOSTICS("BUG: Two or more parallel calls to read a sector.\n");
If you see this diagnostic, your code has called the device to read a sector
while it is still processing the previous read.  The read side of the
device can only handle one sector at a time.

Both of these are reporting bugs in your code that you must fix.
