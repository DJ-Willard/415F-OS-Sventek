Current Submission Status:
	Compiles with no errors not functioning as expected read and read thread end unexceptedly.

Helpers:

Jay Taylor:  developed high minded flow chart idea, helper with syntax issue, supplied web resource for initialization of mutex.

Adam Case: Help with debugging, global variable issue. 

Turan Bulut: help with general questions on voucher how I set up my voucher.

Dr. Joe Sventek: answered question about buff. Thought it was a thread safe array not queue. It was a queue.


Diagram 1 description:	Init flow
	set a global Disk Device, read buffer size 10(max pid), write buffer(max pid), voucher buffer (size of #sd = 30 for runing demo for 1 sec) 
	initialize FSDS(mem length - mem start), write thread, read thread
	define stucture: sd, status var, pthread mutex, pthread conditional, var type of request
	
Diagram 2 top description: write flow
	application thread call write function.
		Wait till return voucher (at end of write function)
	write function fetches a voucher writes in a sd to voucher, update status 		though helper function enqueues the voucher into the write buffer 		update voucher status.
	
	write thread pick up the bounded buffer  voucher and write to disk 			(critical section) returning success or failure into storage in 			voucher status. 

Diagram 2 bottom description: read flow
	application thread calls read function 
		returns the voucher with the sd data
	enqueues the voucher into read buffer
	read thread pull voucher out of read queue and reads for disk 
	returns sd data read in voucher
	
Diagram 3 description: voucher redemption flow
	redeem voucher can be called at any time but will be blocked until the 		read or write is complete.
	Once complete status is returned in voucher
	if read return sd data in SD form voucher then recycle voucher to free 		list buff
	if write recycle voucher to free voucher list buff

Diagram 4 function aid for me.
